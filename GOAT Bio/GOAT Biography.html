							<h3>Tom Brady's Career:</h3>
							<ul style="padding:0;">
								<li><strong>2000</strong>: Brady was selected with pick #199, a compensatory pick, in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. Brady started the season as the fourth string quarterback. By season's end, he was number two on the depth chart behind Drew Bledsoe.</li>
								<li><strong>2001*</strong>: In Brady's first playoff game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on an Adam Vinatieri field goal. Brady was named MVP of Super Bowl XXXVI while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions.</li>
								<li><strong>2002*</strong>: The Patriots missed the playoffs.</li>
								<li><strong>2003*</strong>: Brady led the Patriots to a 32–29 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time.</li>
								<li><strong>2004*</strong>: On February 6, 2005, the Patriots narrowly defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 24–21, to win Super Bowl XXXIX</li>
								<li><strong>2007</strong>: Brady led the Patriots to the first 16–0 regular season record in league history, outscoring opponents by more than a 2-to-1 margin. The Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21–12, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons.</li>
								<li><strong>2008</strong>: Brady did not play in any games during the 2008 preseason or in the 2008 Pro Bowl due to two different foot injuries.</li>
								<li><strong>2011</strong>: In Super Bowl XLVI, Brady and the Patriots met the New York Giants in a rematch of their Super Bowl XLII meeting four years earlier. A final score of 21–17 for the Giants prevented Brady from winning his fourth Super Bowl.</li>
								<li><strong>2014*</strong>: In Super Bowl XLIX, Brady completed 37-of-50 passes for 328 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. He guided a then-record ten-point fourth quarter comeback as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–24 to give Brady his fourth Super Bowl ring</li>
								<li><strong>2016*</strong>: Brady and the Patriots faced the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons—who boasted the league's highest scoring offense—in Super Bowl LI. With the victory, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl, which set a record for most Super Bowl victories of any quarterback in history.</li>
