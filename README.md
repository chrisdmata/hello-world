# hello-world
This is my first repository, where I will commit what I have coded everyday.
My name is Chris Mata. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering, and decided to learn web development.

These commits may include algorithms coded in Javascript or C++, and project websites.
My goal is to code a little everyday.
