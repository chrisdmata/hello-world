		<h3 style="text-align: center">Roland Deschain</h3>
		<p style="margin-right: 30px">Roland Deschain is the protagonist and hero of The Dark Tower Series. He is the son of Steven and Gabrielle Deschain and is the last of a long line of "gunslingers", peacekeepers and diplomats of Roland's society. He is also the final human descendant of Arthur Eld. His image and personality are largely inspired by the "Man with No Name" from three of Sergio Leone's westerns, though his quest and many of his personal and internal conflicts are drawn from Robert Browning's poem Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: center">Jake Chambers</h3>
		<p style="margin-right: 30px">Jake is a smaller, blonde version of Roland. He is described as possessing sharp senses, fearless demeanor and desire to find where he belongs on the quest for the Dark Tower. Even without directions from Roland, Jake Chambers seems to have strong survivor instinct in the mix of the worlds. Due to the fact that he was killed by the man in black, he often gets overwhelmed about his role in the world and takes potential signs and hints from the universe very seriously. He finds it very important that the ka-tet be open and honest with one another.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: center">Eddie Dean</h3>
		<p style="margin-right: 30px">
		Edward Cantor "Eddie" Dean first appears in The Drawing of the Three, in which Roland encounters three doors that open into the New York City of our world in different times. Through these doors, Roland draws companions who will join him on his quest, as the Man In Black foretold. The first to be drawn is Eddie Dean, a drug addict and a first-time cocaine mule. Eddie lives with his older brother and fellow junkie Henry, whom Eddie reveres despite the corrupting influence Henry has had upon his life. It is because of Eddie's heroin addiction that he is termed 'The Prisoner', and that is what is written upon the door from which Roland draws him.</p>
